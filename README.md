# Memory Objects

## Description
Code files and design files for Chong's MS project at Georgia Tech.

The project explores using daily objects as evocative objects. To archive that, I design a wearable device that reads RFID tags, and coded a application that records/replays memory pieces, such as text, photos, and voices. 

###This is project includes
####A Arduino based device
####A Mobile App(iOS) that connects to a online database (Firebase)
